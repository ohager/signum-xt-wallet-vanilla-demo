# Get Started

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to make development and deployment a breeze.

It is required that you have NodeJS (14+) installed on your machine, such you can take full advantage of 

- Development with Live Reload (HMR)
- Optimized, Bundled, Minified static site

Once cloned this repo and having NodeJS installed just hit:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open brower at "http://localhost:5173"
4. Start hacking

> Good reasons for using Vite, can be read [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html#the-problems) 

# Deployment

If you go the modern tooling way, just run `npm run build` - This creates an optimized static site in the `./dist` folder, 
which can hosted anywhere then.
